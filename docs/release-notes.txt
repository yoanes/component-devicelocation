==== Version 1.0.6 (tag: template_v1_0_6) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.6 (and 1.0.5 since I skipped that tag) 
of the rockit Common UI project (http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). 
These iterations focused mainly on stabilising the framework.

==== Version 1.0.4 (tag: template_v1_0_4) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.4 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on adding logging support to the current framework, adding a template
component and fixing up various other, smaller issues.
