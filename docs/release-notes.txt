==== Version 2.0.12 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_12) ====

Default environment property files are no longer shipped with the component. This is due to the Mobiles team restructure.
There is no longer anything common between the environments of each app and hence the components can no longer predict 
sensible defaults.

Upgrade steps:
1. _Before you upgrade_, take the version prior to this and extract all property files that match the following pattern
    from the component's jar file:

    au/com/sensis/mobile/web/component/devicelocation/devicelocation-environment.properties.<platform>
    
2. Place these property files in your project source tree somewhere.

3. Change your build scripts to ensure that these property files result in devicelocation-environment.properties being in the
   root of your classpath at deployment time. For example:
   
   a) when building the deployment unit for dev, devicelocation-environment.properties.dev should be copied to 
      devicelocation-environment.properties in the root of the deployed app's classpath.
   b) when building the deployment unit for prd, devicelocation-environment.properties.prd should be copied to 
      devicelocation-environment.properties in the root of the deployed app's classpath.
      
4. Now you can upgrade your dependency and pull in the new version of this component.

5. For future upgrades, note that the following file in the jar is provided as a template for you to check what properties
   should be specified by your app.

remove complicated stop() call
add softReset()
add exitOnError option

==== Version 2.0.10 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_10) ====
Depends on sdpcommon-manager 1.1.0

==== Version 2.0.9 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_9) ====

Put flag on parseError() to prevent inifinte loop of methods calling between stop() and parseError()

==== Version 2.0.8 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_8) ====

Safe guard the postLocate() by checking if the lastRecordedPosition != null

==== Version 2.0.7 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_7) ====

Refactor the YM setting out of the component. The setting now sits in the YM app itself

==== Version 2.0.6 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_6) ====

All JSPs and JSP tag files now set trimDirectiveWhitespaces="true".

Now depends on:

    <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-core-component" rev="2.0.6" conf="default,test"/>

==== Version 2.0.5 (tag: devicelocation_v2_0_5) ====

Jiras:
* CUI-328 GPS - should not be served to Apple OS 0.x, 1.x, 2.x and 3.0.x 
    * Fixed group config expr to exclude Apple OS 0.x, 1.x, 2.x and 3.0.x (previous expression 
      tried to do this but got it wrong).
    * Also made a bunch of other fixes whilst I was at it: 
        * Fixed config to be consistent. Previous config made it look like Blackberry 9000 would 
          get deviicelocation when in fact it would not. 
        * Added "devicelocation" prefix to group names since the expressions are devicelocation 
          specific.
        * setup.tag now routes to setup.jsp so that the setup tags of dependencies are not called
          if the current device is not supported by this device location component.  
            
            <base:setup device="${device}"/>
            <util:setup device="${device}"/>
            <logging:setup device="${device}"/>
              
        * Fixed showcase so that the behaviour is actually correct. Fixed checkstyle warnings.

Upgrade notes:
- should be transparent.
